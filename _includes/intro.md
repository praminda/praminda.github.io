Hello! I’m Praminda Jayawardana, a hands-on lead engineer who designs, builds, and guides teams to deliver secure, high-performance systems at scale.

Over the past decade, I’ve engineered API managers, gateways, authentication frameworks, rate-limiting proxies, and distributed services handling millions of requests per day.

When the stakes are high and quality is non-negotiable, I’m the one you’d trust to get it done right.

Recently, I’ve been exploring Web3 and AI technologies, intrigued by their potential to build systems more efficiently and secure them with transparency.

Hello! I’m Praminda Jayawardana a lead software engineer who designs and delivers secure, high-performance systems powering real-world applications at scale. I’ve guided teams through major backend challenges. Building API managers, API gateways, authentication platforms, rate-limiting proxies, and other distributed services that serve millions of requests per day.

Recently, I’ve been exploring Web3 and AI technologies, intrigued by their potential to build systems more efficiently and secure them with transparency.

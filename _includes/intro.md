Hello! I’m Praminda Jayawardana,

Over the past decade, I've engineered API managers and gateways, authentication frameworks, data pipelines, AI integrated services, and other distributed services handling millions of requests per hour.

Recently, I’ve been exploring AI technologies and Web3, intrigued by their potential to build systems more efficiently and secure them with transparency.

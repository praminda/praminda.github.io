A cloud-native API gateway for microservices. Choreo Connect separates control and data planes for scalability, security, and performance. It supports dynamic configuration via gRPC-based xDS protocol, OpenAPI definitions, and integrates with WSO2 Choreo. Features include authentication, rate-limiting, observability, analytics, and distributed tracing. The gateway reliably handled ~3000 transactions per second with latency under 250ms for 1000 concurrent users on constrained hardware (1 CPU, 512MB memory).

**Key responsibilities:**
- One of the founding engineers
- Contributed to architecting the core product with scalability, performance, runtime mutability, and ease of maintenance as primary goals.
- Led the control plane development in Go.
- Contributed to the data plane in Java; filter chain implementation, authentication, and observability using Envoy ext_auth filter.

**Languages**: `Go`, `Java`, `Protobuf`  
**Tools**:  
  - `gRPC + xDS Protocol` – to stream API and routing configurations from control plane to gateway in real time  
  - `OpenAPI` – for defining API structure and generating gateway configs  
  - `Kubernetes` – for deployment orchestration and service mesh integration  
  - `Prometheus` – for gateway telemetry and monitoring  
  - `Jaeger` – for distributed tracing  
  - `OAuth2/JWT` – for authentication and policy enforcement  
  - `Envoy` – as the base TCP proxy to implement gateway filter chain  
  - `GitHub Actions` – for CI/CD automation and test pipelines

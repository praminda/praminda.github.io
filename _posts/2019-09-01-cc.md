A cloud-native API gateway for microservices. Choreo Connect separates control and data planes for scalability, security, and performance. It supports dynamic configuration via gRPC-based xDS protocol, OpenAPI definitions, and integrates with WSO2 Choreo. Features include authentication, rate-limiting, observability, distributed tracing, etc. The gateway reliably handled ~2000 transactions per second with latency under 250ms, even on minimal hardware.

As a founding engineer, I helped architect and implement the gRPC-based xDS protocol for real-time, secure control plane–data plane communication, enabling dynamic API and routing updates. I led the control plane development in Go and contributed to the data plane in Java, filter chain implementation, authentication, and observability using Envoy filters.

- **Languages**: `Go`, `Java`, `Protobuf`  
- **Tools**:  
  - `gRPC + xDS Protocol` – to stream API and routing configurations from control plane to gateway in real time  
  - `OpenAPI` – for defining API structure and generating gateway configs  
  - `Kubernetes` – for deployment orchestration and service mesh integration  
  - `Prometheus` – for gateway telemetry and monitoring  
  - `Jaeger` – for distributed tracing  
  - `OAuth2/JWT` – for authentication and policy enforcement  
  - `Envoy` – as the base TCP proxy to implement gateway filter chain  
  - `GitHub Actions` – for CI/CD automation and test pipelines

A cloud-native, developer-centric API gateway for microservices that simplifies composing, securing, and monitoring microservice endpoints as managed APIs. It supports OpenAPI-driven configuration, runtime service discovery, legacy-to-modern API transformation, and can be deployed as lightweight, stateless containers in CI/CD pipelines.

As an founding engineer of the project, I drove the architecture and initial implementation of the Microgateway core and toolkit. I defined the OpenAPI parsing engine, built the security and other API QoS features. I also led containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes deployment strategies, established CI/CD workflows, and collaborated with UX and DevOps teams to expose a unified developer experience and rich observability.

- **Languages**: `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Bash`  
- **Tools**:  
  - `OpenAPI Spec` – for declarative API definitions and gateway config generation 
  - `Docker` – to package the gateway runtime as lightweight containers  
  - `Kubernetes` – for orchestrating and scaling gateway instances
  - `Prometheus`, `Jaeger`, `Zipkin` – for collecting metrics and tracing
  - `JMeter` – to load-test gateway performance under high throughput
  - `GitHub Actions` – to automate build, test, and release pipelines

An AI agent designed to automate web GUI testing and reduce repetitive QA work on frontend applications. Built as a Crew AI multi-agent system, it interprets feature requirements and QA scenarios, then generates Cypress tests. The process starts by providing clear test documentation and a live app URL to `browser-use`, which identifies the necessary actions. Another agent then converts these steps into a Cypress test suite.

I led and developed this tool as part of a broader framework for automating QA, collaborating with other team members on the overall system.

- **Languages**: `Python`
- **Tools**:
    - `Browser-Use` â€“ External API contract design and validation

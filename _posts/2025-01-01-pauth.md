---

A scalable multi-tenant identity and access management framework for microservices, built to securely handle thousands of authentication requests with <10ms latency on dual-core, 256MB–512MB hardware. It featured a distributed apikey/token cache implemented using apache pulsar streams natively supported by the Macrometa GDN.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Led the architecture and development, focusing on tenant isolation, performance, and scalability.
- Designed and implemented the v2 of the framework, prioritizing Single-Sign-On (SSO), resiliency, and API clarity.
- Developed and improved API key/JWT flows, caching, observability, and metrics.
- Main contact point for auth framework issues on the platform.
- Contributed to React based SSO login components as needed.

**Languages**: `Rust`, `React`  
**Tools**:
  - `Tokio` – Rust async runtime
  - `Macrometa GDN` – Tenant data modeling and storage
  - `Prometheus` – Metrics collection 
  - `Auth0` – Multi-option SSO provider
  - `Kubernetes` – Containerized development and deployment
  - `GitHub Actions` + `Argo` – CI/CD
  - `Apache Pulsar` – Message queue/broker to keep local caches up-to-date

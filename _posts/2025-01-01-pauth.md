title: Multi-Tenant Auth Framework
role: Lead Engineer

A scalable multi-tenant identity and access management framework for microservices, built to securely handle thousands of authentication requests with <10ms latency on dual-core, 256MB–512MB hardware.

I led the architecture and development, focusing on tenant isolation, API key/JWT flows, SSO, caching, and integrating observability and metrics. I am the main contact for auth framework issues on the platform. Contributed to react based SSO login components as needed.

- **Languages**: `Rust`, `React`
- **Tools**:
    - `Tokio` – Rust async runtime
    - `Macrometa GDN` – Tenant data modeling and storage
    - `Prometheus` – Metrics collection 
    - `Auth0` – Multi-option SSO provider
    - `Kubernetes` – Containerized development and deployment
    - `GitHub Actions` + `Argo` – CI/CD

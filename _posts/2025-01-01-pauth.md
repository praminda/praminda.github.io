title: Multi-Tenant Auth Framework
role: Lead Engineer

A centralized multi-tenant identity and access management framework for multi-tenant microservices, designed to handle thousands of authentication requests securely and efficiently.

I led the architecture and development, focusing on tenant isolation, API key/JWT flows, SSO, and caching. I also integrated observability and metrics for operational resilience. I am the main point of contact for auth framework issues on the platform.

- **Languages**: `Rust`
- **Tools**:
    - `Tokio` - Rust async runtime
    - `Macrometa GDN` – Tenant data modeling and storage
    - `Prometheus` – Metrics collection 
    - `Auth0` - As multi option sso provider
    - `Kubernetes` – Consistent containerized development and deployment
    - `Github Actions` + `Argo` - CI and CD

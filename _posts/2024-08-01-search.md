A semantic and lexical search engine for indexing and retrieving context-aware results from large volumes of structured and unstructured data. It supports complex queries with filters using vector similarity and lexical similarity, and can provide context-aware answers to questions, based on search results. Data is ingested from sources like S3 and websites, cleaned, and optimized for search. Key challenges included indexing millions of records in 1–2 hours and delivering AI-powered answers within 1 second.

I led the design and development of data ingestion pipelines, document transformation, indexing workflows, and semantic search APIs for flexible querying across metadata filters.

- **Languages**: `Python`, `Rust`  
- **Tools**:  
    - `Macrometa GDN` – Data store, Vector store and underlying search provider
    - `FastAPI` – HTTP framework and the interface to the users
    - `Docker & Kubernetes` – For deployment and scaling. Including the production environments
    - `Github Actions` + `Argo` - CI and CD

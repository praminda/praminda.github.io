A semantic and lexical search engine for indexing and retrieving context-aware results from large volumes of structured and unstructured data. It supports complex queries with filters using vector similarity and lexical similarity, and can provide context-aware answers to questions, based on search results. Data is ingested from sources like S3 and websites, cleaned, and optimized for search. Key challenges were achieving indexing time for 1 million records in <2 hours and delivering search resutls with AI-powered answers within 500ms.

I led the design and implementation of data ingestion pipelines, document transformation processes, indexing workflows, and semantic search APIs that enable flexible querying with metadata filters. Additionally, I contributed to and reviewed the React-based GUI console used for configuring and testing indexing and search functionalities.

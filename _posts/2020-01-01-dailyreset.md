A Flutter-based cross-platform mobile application (iOS, Android) for browsing, viewing, and listening to Buddhist audio and video sermons. The app integrates with the existing backend supporting the website https://waharaka.com. Users can browse sermons by tags or keyword search. It includes a built-in audio player with seek, play, and pause functionality, as well as background playback. Users can also download audio sermons to their devices.
